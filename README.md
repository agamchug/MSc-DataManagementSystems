# MSc-DataManagementSystems
Store, manipulate, restructure, and analyse GitHub data (commits, authors, source codes, etc) on PyTorch and Tensorflow. Both projects are examples of open source software (OSS) development.  The aim is for data to be efficiently queried in MongoDB and further extracting insights into collaboration between authors, commit-level activity, and seasonality in OSS projects using PySpark. 

### 1. Analysis.pdf: The complete rationale behind the restructuring steps and proof of improved efficiency. The file also includes results of data analysis including network graph using PySpark
### 2. pymongo_dms.ipynb: The entire code leveraging PyMongo and PySpark to manipulate and query data and gather deeper insights.
